\section{Introduction} %A brief description of what you plan to do and your goals
According to \emph{Dalal et. al.}\cite{dalal05} locally normalized histogram of gradient orientations in 
a dense overlapping grid provides higher performance and a lower rate of false positives than (at the time)
existing feature sets for detecting humans from images. In their study they experimented 
with different parameters and found that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, 
relatively course spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in 
overlapping descriptor blocks are most suitable.

The general algorithm is composed of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Input image
  \item Normalize gamma and colour 
  \item Compute gradients
  \item Weighted vote into spatial and orientation cells
  \item Contrast normalize over overlapping spatial blocks
  \item Collect HOG’s over detection window
  \item Linear SVM
  \item Person / non−person classification
\end{enumerate}

In the referenced paper, the authors refer to the set of parameters/methods that produce 
optimal performance as their ``default detector'', which has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item RGB color space with no gamma correction
  \item $[-1, 0, 1]$ gradient filter with no smoothing
  \item linear gradient voting into 9 orientation bins in 0-180 degrees
  \item 16x16 pixel blocks of four 8x8 cells
  \item Gaussian spatial window with $\alpha = 8$ pixels
  \item Lowe-style clipped L2 norm block normalization
  \item Block spacing stride of 8 pixels
  \item 64x128 detection window
  \item linear SVM classifier
\end{itemize}

\section{Inputs and Outputs}
The input to the algorithm will be the two data-sets referenced in the original paper: 
The MIT pedestrian database (509 training and 200 test images of pedestrians) as well 
as the more difficult INRIA data-set (1,805 64x128 images).

The SVM will be trained with 1,239 of these images and their left-right reflections as positive training examples,
yeilding a total 2,478 positive training images. 1,218 human-free images will used as a negative training set.

The output of the algorithm is a per image classification of human/non-human.

\section{Metrics} % How you will evaluate the project
The project will be a success if we are able to mimic the results found by \emph{Dalal et. al.} 
We will not be testing all the permutations that they did, but rather the permutation 
(described above) that yielded the best results with $84\%$ at $10^{-4}$ false positives per window.
